  ✔ General Fixes @done(18-07-19 16:56)
    ✔ The site jumps when moving between pages which I think is due to the browser adding the scroll bar to the page @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-12 17:29) @lasted(4m22s)
      Yup, that was the issue.
    ✔ Add a scroll to top button @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-13 17:56) @lasted(1d31m14s)
      ✔ Move scroll to top button to its own component and add it to the whole site @started(18-07-13 17:56) @done(18-07-17 12:50) @lasted(3d18h54m52s)
        ✔ See if you can make it a stateless functional component @started(18-07-13 17:57) @done(18-07-17 12:50) @lasted(3d18h53m55s)
        //This might be possible but not really worth it for this project.A stateful component does the trick just fine.
        ✘ Ensure the scroll-to-top btn is viewable at relevant times and doesn't overlap important content. @started(18-07-17 13:31) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:51) @wasted(1d23h20m51s)
          // This is just a whole thing I dont want to get into right now.
        ✔ Sometimes the main nav buttons have to be clicked twice to work properly. I haven't been able to replicate this consistantly but it does happen @started(18-07-13 18:03) @done(18-07-17 13:46) @lasted(3d19h43m32s)
        ✔ This is all down to padding. I will need to adjust this to maintain the same look @started(18-07-17 12:55) @done(18-07-17 13:46) @lasted(51m33s)
        // Changed li display to table, removed padding and hey presto.
      ✘ I am mainly designing the website for 918px but I want to make the website responsive @cancelled(18-07-19 12:03)
        // Will focus on building something more responsive in the next project
      ✔ The design seems a bit unsymetrical when moving through the pages. Try and ensure that the content is of similiar width if possible. @started(18-07-17 13:50) @done(18-07-19 12:57) @lasted(1d23h7m42s)
      ✔ In general the page is a bit "sloppy". Give it a pass when you think you're finished and clean things up @done(18-07-19 12:57)

  ✔ Home Page @done(18-07-19 16:56)
    ✘ Prevent Date from being rendered every time the home button is clicked @started(18-07-12 17:25) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:27) @wasted(6d19h2m22s)

      ✔ Add B&W icons to 3rd footer column
    ✘ Add Full width component to Home page somewhere preferabbly between the first and second row of cards @started(18-07-12 17:25) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:05) @wasted(6d18h40m42s)
        // Not relevant to the overall point of the project which is to be better at routes.
    ✔ Add Slideshow / Full Width Image to home page @done(18-07-12 17:16)
      ✔ Make slideshow its own component @started(18-07-12 17:17) @done(18-07-12 17:23) @lasted(6m54s)
      ✘ The Carousel html can probably be made a lot more programatic than it currently is. @started(18-07-12 17:25) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:06) @wasted(6d18h41m15s)
        //Not relevant to this project. I will think more about this in future projects.
      ✔ The Carousel caption needs to be prettied up. @started(18-07-12 17:26) @done(18-07-19 12:25) @lasted(6d18h59m47s)
      ✔ Make carousel the correct width to line up with the rest of the page @started(18-07-12 17:27) @done(18-07-19 12:25) @lasted(6d18h58m59s)
      ✘ See if you can change the carousel animation to have them slide in rather than fade in and out. @started(18-07-12 17:28) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:26) @wasted(6d18h58m37s)
        //Not going to happen with this carousel. it uses opacity to create the animation
      ✔ Clean up carousel controls @started(18-07-12 17:30) @done(18-07-19 12:27) @lasted(6d18h57m3s)
      ✔ The fonts don't seem to be working on the home page or anywhere else @started(18-07-17 13:56) @done(18-07-19 12:58) @lasted(1d23h2m6s)

  ✔ Feature page @done(18-07-19 16:56)
    ✔ Do a large gallery of images rather than a slideshow @started(18-07-12 17:26) @done(18-07-13 14:00) @lasted(20h34m56s)
    ✔ Fill out gallery with content @done(18-07-13 16:48)
      ✔ Content should include random images @done(18-07-13 16:48)
    ✔ Make one or the other the default @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-13 18:00) @lasted(1d35m52s)
    ✘ Change any instance of "slideshow" to "gallery" @started(18-07-13 18:01) @cancelled(18-07-19 12:29) @wasted(5d18h28m49s)
      //No point. I can live with this for the sake of this project
      // I do need to be more careful and think more about what I name things.
    ✔ I Should expand the routes to include pages within the gallery items @started(18-07-13 17:28) @done(18-07-19 13:38) @lasted(5d20h10m29s)
      ✔ For example you click on a square and it takes you to a dedicated page. @started(18-07-13 17:27) @done(18-07-19 13:38) @lasted(5d20h11m30s)
      // Was not as hard as I thought and in fact was quite simole
      // I actually think this will be the basis for a future news website style project
      // All that is left is to clean up the ui and add some more content 
      ✔ Make the Caption Unique @started(18-07-19 13:41) @done(18-07-19 13:51) @lasted(10m46s)
      ✔ Add Random Image to sub-page like the gallery page @started(18-07-19 13:41) @done(18-07-19 16:56) @lasted(3h15m35s)
        ✔ Bonus Points for making it the same image as on the gallery page @started(18-07-19 13:41) @done(18-07-19 16:56) @lasted(3h15m37s)
      ✔ Format the sub-page to be like a news article, blog or whatever but just make it look decent @started(18-07-19 13:41) @done(18-07-19 16:56) @lasted(3h15m38s)
      ✔ So the post date json object has a space and thats a problem for using it with jsx and state... @started(18-07-19 13:52) @done(18-07-19 16:56) @lasted(3h4m41s)
    ✘ I like the idea of changing the gallery size on the click of a button but I think that would require the use of state which would in turn require changing the component. @cancelled(18-07-19 12:03)
       // A bit beyond the scope of this project. Maybe in th next.
    ✔ Add content to the video page @started(18-07-17 12:52) @done(18-07-17 15:38) @lasted(2h46m46s)

      ✔ Add a header row above the main body of content @started(18-07-17 13:31) @done(18-07-19 12:00) @lasted(1d22h29m46s)
   

  // Ideas for next Project
  ☐ A form that you can use to submit to a database (Firebase)
    ☐ The website would then be populated by things from the database.
    ☐ Make the form visible to certain users.
    ☐ Basically I want to build a CMS that logged in users can access.
  ☐ Wrap <Link> around elements so that entire elements are links instead of a single button.
  ☐ Use higher res images for thumbnails.
    ☐ Maybe make use of the html5 image tag
