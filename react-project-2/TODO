  ☐ General Fixes
    ✔ The site jumps when moving between pages which I think is due to the browser adding the scroll bar to the page @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-12 17:29) @lasted(4m22s)
      Yup, that was the issue.
    ✔ Add a scroll to top button @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-13 17:56) @lasted(1d31m14s)
      ✔ Move scroll to top button to its own component and add it to the whole site @started(18-07-13 17:56) @done(18-07-17 12:50) @lasted(3d18h54m52s)
        ✔ See if you can make it a stateless functional component @started(18-07-13 17:57) @done(18-07-17 12:50) @lasted(3d18h53m55s)
        //This might be possible but not really worth it for this project.A stateful component does the trick just fine.
        ☐ Ensure the scroll-to-top btn is viewable at relevant times and doesn't overlap important content. @started(18-07-17 13:31)
      ✔ Sometimes the main nav buttons have to be clicked twice to work properly. I haven't been able to replicate this consistantly but it does happen @started(18-07-13 18:03) @done(18-07-17 13:46) @lasted(3d19h43m32s)
        ✔ This is all down to padding. I will need to adjust this to maintain the same look @started(18-07-17 12:55) @done(18-07-17 13:46) @lasted(51m33s)
        // Changed li display to table, removed padding and hey presto.
      ☐ I am mainly designing the website for 918px but I want to make the website responsive
      ☐ The design seems a bit unsymetrical when moving through the pages. Try and ensure that the content is of similiar width if possible. @started(18-07-17 13:50)

    ☐ Add Full width component to Home page somewhere preferabbly between the first and second row of cards @started(18-07-12 17:25)
    ✔ Add Slideshow / Full Width Image to home page @done(18-07-12 17:16)
      ✔ Make slideshow its own component @started(18-07-12 17:17) @done(18-07-12 17:23) @lasted(6m54s)
      ☐ The Carousel html can probably be made a lot more programatic than it currently is. @started(18-07-12 17:25)
      ☐ The Carousel caption needs to be prettied up. @started(18-07-12 17:26)
      ☐ Make carousel the correct width to line up with the rest of the page @started(18-07-12 17:27)
      ☐ See if you can change the carousel animation to have them slide in rather than fade in and out. @started(18-07-12 17:28)
      ☐ Clean up carousel controls @started(18-07-12 17:30)
      ☐ The fonts don't seem to be working on the home page or anywhere else @started(18-07-17 13:56)

  ☐ Feature page
    ✔ Do a large gallery of images rather than a slideshow @started(18-07-12 17:26) @done(18-07-13 14:00) @lasted(20h34m56s)
    ✔ Fill out gallery with content @done(18-07-13 16:48)
      ✔ Content should include random images @done(18-07-13 16:48)
    ✔ Make one or the other the default @started(18-07-12 17:25) @done(18-07-13 18:00) @lasted(1d35m52s)
    ☐ Change any instance of "slideshow" to "gallery" @started(18-07-13 18:01)
    ☐ I Should expand the routes to include pages within the gallery items @started(18-07-13 17:28)
      ☐ For example you click on a square and it takes you to a dedicated page. @started(18-07-13 17:27)
    ☐ I like the idea of changing the gallery size on the click of a button but I think that would require the use of state which would in turn require changing the component.
    ☐ Add a content to the video page @started(18-07-17 12:52)
    
  
  ☐ About page
    ✔ Add Content to the about page @started(18-07-17 12:56) @done(18-07-17 13:30) @lasted(34m11s)
